# JustTuner

A simple yet accurate chromatic tuner.

## Quick start

Just visit the [app website.](justtuner.pages.dev)

> **Note:** the tuner needs microphone access – grant permission when your browser asks for it, so the app can hear your instrument.

## How It Works

**Note name & frequency** — Shows what note you're playing and its frequency in Hz.

**Needle gauge** — Tells you how far off you are:

- Left (flat ♭) — Your pitch is too low
- Center (green) — Perfect! You're in tune
- Right (sharp ♯) — Your pitch is too high

## Tips for Best Results

- **Keep it quiet** — Close a window if it's loud.
- **Steady note** — Hold a smooth, sustained note.
- **Distance** — Keep your phone 20–30 cm from your instrument.

## Works With

Any instrument that makes a clear pitch:

- 🎸 Guitar, bass, ukulele, violin, strings
- 🎺 Trumpet, sax, harmonica, wind instruments
- 🎹 Keyboards, synthesizers
- 🎤 Vocals (singing)

## For the nerds

The app uses its own implementation of the YIN algorithm for pitch detection.
